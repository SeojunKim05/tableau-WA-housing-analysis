## 📌 Notes

While a PowerPoint version (`WA Housing Trend Presentation.pptx`) is provided for static viewing, the full analytical experience is best accessed through the Tableau workbook (`WA Housing Trend.twb`).

The `.twb` file contains **fully interactive dashboards**, allowing users to:
- Hover over maps and charts to see detailed tooltips
- Use slicers and filters to isolate specific counties or years
- Navigate seamlessly between pages using the built-in progression bar
- Dynamically compare housing trends across decades and jurisdictions

For the most accurate insights and flexible exploration, open the `.twb` file directly in Tableau Desktop.
